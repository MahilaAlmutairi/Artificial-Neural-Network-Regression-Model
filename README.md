# Artificial Neural Network Regression Model
In this notebook, an artificial neural network classifier was built.  In particular, a two-layer feed-forward neural network ( that predicts a student's chance of getting accepted in graduate school using three features (GRE_score, TOEFL _score, and GPA)) was trained. The data set has four examples for training and three examples for testing.
